# Benchmark Work Group

The Benchmark working group's purpose is to gain consensus for an agreed set of benchmarks that can be used to:

1. track and evangelize performance gains made between Node releases
2. avoid performance regressions between releases

Its responsibilities are:

1. Identify 1 or more benchmarks that reflect customer usage.  Likely need more than one to cover typical Node use cases including low-latency and high concurrency
2. Work to get community consensus on the list chosen
3. Add regular execution of chosen benchmarks to Node builds
4. Track/publicize performance between builds/releases


AcmeAir is proposed as one of the benchmark to consider: https://github.com/acmeair/acmeair-nodejs

Initial proposed members include:
  + Michael Dawson
  + Trevor Norris
  + Yang Lei
  + Ali Sheikh
  + Chris Bailey
  + Yosuke Furukawa
  + + reach out to contacts at Payal, Yahoo, Netflix who might be interested
  + + other interested parties from Node.js and io.js communities
