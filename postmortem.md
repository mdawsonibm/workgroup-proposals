#Post Mortem Diagnostics Working Group

The Post Mortem Diagnostics working group is dedicated to support and improvement of port mortem debugging for Node.  It seeks to provide the APIs/tools needed to generate dumps when required and to use these dumps to be able to debug issues. Responsibilities include:

1. Defining and adding interfaces/APIs in order to allow dumps to be generated when needed
2. Defining and adding common structures to the dumps generated in order to support tools that want to introspect those dumps

Initial proposed members include:

  + Howard Hellyer
  + David Pacheco 
  + Julien Gilli
  + Michael Dawson
  + any others interested from io.js and Node.js communities

If the tracing working group from io.js joins the foundation, we'd need to consider if this group should remain separate or be part of a merged working group.
